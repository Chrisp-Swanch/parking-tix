# parking-tix

This is a web app for automatically contesting parking tickets.

It uses the OpenAi and Gmail api's, as well as an internal sqlite3 database. It was my final group project for Dev Academy, made over the course of a week.

The idea for this app was my own brain-child. It is a 'for-fun' exploration of using automation as a tool for anti-dark-patterns design. 

My dev work on this was mostly around constructing the backend, and setting up the OpenAi functionality. I also worked on the React components, and Redux features.
